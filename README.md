Hi I'm Noah!
Iâ€™m a current General Assembly student projected to graduate in October with a Computer Science degree in progress as well! I love a good challenge and finding creative approaches to problem solving and using the skills I picked up from my Naval Medicine background to find those creative answers. I love a collaborative team environment where I can learn from my peers and add to my existing leadership skills by working under an inspiring leader. Reach me at my socials below :)
